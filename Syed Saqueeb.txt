ðŸ”‘ What is a Primary Key?

A Primary Key in SQL is a column (or a combination of columns) that uniquely identifies each record in a table. It ensures that no two rows have the same value and cannot contain NULL values.


1.A Primary Key uniquely identifies each record in a table.

2.It must be unique and cannot be NULL.

3.Each table can have only one primary key, but it can be made of multiple columns (composite key).

EXAMPLE :

CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(100)
);


Foreign Key (FK) - The Relationship Builder
A Foreign Key is like a class section in schoolâ€”it connects students to their respective classes. While multiple students may belong to the same class, each class must exist in the Class table first!
ðŸ“Œ Rules for a Foreign Key:
- It links one table to another
- It refers to the Primary Key in another table
- It can have duplicate values

EXAMPLE:

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EmployeeName VARCHAR(100),
    Email VARCHAR(100),
    DepartmentID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID)
);

When we use this code in SQL with the starting  from creating database to create table it shown like

CODE:


CREATE DATABASE WainfoTechnologies;
USE WainfoTechnologies;


CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(100)
);

INSERT INTO Departments (DepartmentID, DepartmentName) 
VALUES 
    (1, 'IT'),
    (2, 'HR'),
    (3, 'Finance');


CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EmployeeName VARCHAR(100),
    Email VARCHAR(100),
    DepartmentID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID)
);

INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Email, DepartmentID) 
VALUES 
    (4, 'Shaikh Saied', 'saied1104@gmail.com', 1);

	
	select *from Departments
	select *from Employees
